In this repository i will upload open hardware projects made by me from time to time

## Differential Probe
In this project i have developed a differential probe for my oscilloscope. The device is capable of measuring a voltage range between +- 500V, the user can change the scale from x100 to x10 (reducing the full scale range to +- 50V). The bandwith of the probe is around 10 MHz.
